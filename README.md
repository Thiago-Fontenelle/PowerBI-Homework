# PowerBI-Homework
This repository is destined to keep and share my PowerBI homehork from the last module of the data analyst course by Ada Tech, sponsored by Suzano.

For the first activities I used a videogames sales datased availible on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidtwr/videogames-sales-dataset?select=Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv), using the skills learned in the first class and creating the fofflowing template:

In the second assessment I used the same dataset to experiment some different graphs and use conditional formating and filters on the visual:

For the third assessment I used a Starbucks Worldwide dataset that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starbucks/store-locations) in order to explore map graphs with filters:

In the fouth assessment it was requwsted that we used a crime on the united states dataset to awnser the following questions:

1 - How many crimes were registered?
2 - What are the 10 states with the most crime?
3 - What are the 10 cities with the most crime?
4 - what is the crime rate over the year?

the assessment involved some data cleaning in PowerBI too.
